        <h1>Artist at Heart, Developer by Profession</h1>

        <p>Hi there, I'm Jordan and I'm a web developer <strong>residing and working in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA)</strong>. Coding aside, I have a strong affinity for the idea of making a coherent and beautiful thing from scratch. Whether it be a web app or a gallery-ready work of art, the thought of having all of the knowledge and capability to go out on my own and just be able to do anything has been *the* driving force in my life. It's this vision of self sufficiency that initially drew me toward web development and has always motivated me to learn all the ins and outs of its processes. While my main strength is <strong>full stack development</strong> with <strong>Laravel</strong> and the <strong>LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)</strong>, I try to learn new skills and challenge myself with other technologies when given the opportunity.</p>

        <p>I also have a lot of experience with digital media. Visual art was my first love. I've been drawing for most of my life and it's something I've become very good at. And naturally, living and working in an increasingly digital world, I quickly got into digital art; <strong>Photoshop painting, photography, videography, animation, graphic design</strong> and so on. Of course, at the moment, I do focus more on the arts that pertain to web graphics but I love gaining new knowledge and experiences and pushing myself closer to my goal of self sufficiency.</p>
        
        <p>This wide range of skills that I have access to makes me relatively unique in this field. Where lots developers tend to specialize in the front end or back end exclusively and never even get into digital arts, <strong>I spend my time in all areas of development. From site mapping and mockups to custom graphics and image optimization to UI development and server side scripting</strong>, I have done it all. Now I may not have had a real web development job yet but that's because I don't like starting something without a reliable knowledge base that I can confidently use to back me up. And well, I feel like I have that now. I'm currently <strong>available for hire as a Junior Developer</strong> so if what I can do fits your qualifications then please <a href="/#contact">send me a message</a>, I'm eager to start my career.</p>
